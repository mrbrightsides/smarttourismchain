# 🛠️ SmartTourismChain System Roadmap

Adapted from modern website development flow, this roadmap documents the key stages in the design, implementation, and deployment of the SmartTourismChain system — a blockchain-integrated reservation plugin for the tourism sector.

---

## 1. 🧭 Discovery

- Researching local tourism and UMKM ecosystem
- Identifying OTA inefficiencies and trust gaps
- Literature review on Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and CMS
- Platform selection: Ethereum (Sepolia) + WordPress
- Initial DSRM problem formulation and scope

**📌 Output:** Problem definition, personas, use case draft

---

## 2. ✏️ Prototyping

- Creating system flow wireframes (on-chain/off-chain)
- Designing reservation process and whitelist mechanism
- Initial smart contract draft using Remix IDE
- Planning user journey and admin experience

**📌 Output:** UX mockups, initial smart contract, interaction flow

---

## 3. 🧱 Architecture

- Defining plugin folder structure
- Integrating contract ABI and address into frontend/backend
- Splitting contracts: `SmartTourismToken.sol` and `SmartReservation.sol`
- Planning IoT integration and data pipelines

**📌 Output:** Modular architecture, data flow diagrams, API maps

---

## 4. 🎨 Design

- Designing the UI for reservation and admin panels
- Creating landing page and token logo
- Branding "SmartTourismChain" and "RANTAI"
- Data-informed design decisions based on insights from user behavior, keyword trends, and tourism service gaps

📊 Source data collected via:
  - Web scraping from local OTA platforms
  - Crawling UMKM and hotel directories
  - Result --> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) at: [mrbrightsides/dashboard-EDA](https://github.com/mrbrightsides/dashboard-EDA)

**📌 Output:** UI kit, page templates, data-driven feature prioritization, visualized data

---

## 5. 📝 Content

- Writing technical documentation in `stc-docs`
- Educational narrative for RANTAI landing page
- Creating Blockchain Enterprise class material
- GitHub Classroom starter templates

**📌 Output:** Docs site, content modules, course-ready repos

---

## 6. 🧑‍💻 Development

- Building the WordPress plugin with Web3.js and AJAX
- Implementing on-chain & off-chain reservation logic
- Logging transactions (txHash, timestamp, etc.)
- Verifying booking via QR and wallet address

**📌 Output:** Plugin v1.0 (SmartTourismChain), simulation portal

---

## 7. 🧪 Testing

- Running test transactions on Sepolia Testnet
- Gas fee analysis and performance benchmarking
- Security and logic validation
- Feedback from supervisor and pilot users

**📌 Output:** Evaluation report, bug fixes, ready-to-deploy code

---

## 8. 🚀 Deployment

- Publishing plugin to WordPress repository
- Hosting documentation via GitHub Pages
- Launching [https://smartourism.elpeef.com](https://smartourism.elpeef.com)
- Submitting papers to IMED and IRICT end of 2025

**📌 Output:** Public release, academic publications, open access tools

---

## 9. 🔧 Maintenance

- Updating plugin based on user feedback
- Adding advanced features (NFT tickets, DAO voting, API hooks)
- Field testing with real UMKM and tourism offices
- Exploring multi-chain and Layer-2 scalability

**📌 Output:** Plugin v1.x, updated roadmap, community engagement
